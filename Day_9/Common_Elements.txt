Problem Description
Given two integer arrays, A and B of size N and M, respectively. Your task is to find all the common elements in both the array.

NOTE:

Each element in the result should appear as many times as it appears in both arrays.
The result can be in any order.


Problem Constraints
1 <= N, M <= 105

1 <= A[i] <= 109



Input Format
First argument is an integer array A of size N.

Second argument is an integer array B of size M.



Output Format
Return an integer array denoting the common elements.



Example Input
Input 1:

 A = [1, 2, 2, 1]
 B = [2, 3, 1, 2]
Input 2:

 A = [2, 1, 4, 10]
 B = [3, 6, 2, 10, 10]


Example Output
Output 1:

 [1, 2, 2]
Output 2:

 [2, 10]


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 Elements (1, 2, 2) appears in both the array. Note 2 appears twice in both the array.
Explantion 2:

 Elements (2, 10) appears in both the array.




Solution:


vector<int> Solution::solve(vector<int> &A, vector<int> &B) {

    unordered_map <int,int> s1;
    unordered_map <int,int> s2;
    vector <int> sol;

    for (int i=0; i<A.size(); i++){
        s1[A[i]]++;
    }

    for (int j=0; j<B.size(); j++){
        if (s1.find(B[j])!=s1.end() && s1[B[j]]!=0){
            s1[B[j]]--;
            sol.push_back(B[j]);

        }
    }

    return sol;
}
