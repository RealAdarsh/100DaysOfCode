Problem Description
Given the root node of a Binary Tree denoted by A. You have to Serialize the given Binary Tree in the described format.

Serialize means encode it into a integer array denoting the Level Order Traversal of the given Binary Tree.

NOTE:

In the array, the NULL/None child is denoted by -1.
For more clarification check the Example Input.


Problem Constraints
1 <= number of nodes <= 105



Input Format
Only argument is a A denoting the root node of a Binary Tree.



Output Format
Return an integer array denoting the Level Order Traversal of the given Binary Tree.



Example Input
Input 1:

           1
         /   \
        2     3
       / \
      4   5
Input 2:

            1
          /   \
         2     3
        / \     \
       4   5     6


Example Output
Output 1:

 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1]
Output 2:

 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, -1, 6, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1]


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 The Level Order Traversal of the given tree will be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5 , -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1].
 Since 3, 4 and 5 each has both NULL child we had represented that using -1.
Explanation 2:

 The Level Order Traversal of the given tree will be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, -1, 6, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1].
 Since 3 has left child as NULL while 4 and 5 each has both NULL child.


 Solution:

 /**
 * Definition for binary tree
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
vector<int> Solution::solve(TreeNode* A) {
    queue <TreeNode *> q;
    if (A==NULL) return {};
    q.push(A);
    vector <int> sol;

    while(!q.empty()){
        TreeNode *curr=q.front();
        q.pop();
        if (curr==NULL){
            sol.push_back(-1);
        }
        else {
            sol.push_back(curr->val);
        }

        if (curr!=NULL){
            if (curr->left){
                q.push(curr->left);
            }
            else{
                q.push(NULL);
            }

            if (curr->right){
                q.push(curr->right);
            }
            else{
                q.push(NULL);
            }
        }
    }

    return sol;
}
